# Employee Management System

Welcome to the **Employee Management System** project!  
This is an early-stage C++ project designed to help manage employee records and basic HR operations. The current system is in its initial development phase and will evolve significantly with more features and improvements.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

The goal of this project is to create a robust, user-friendly, and secure platform for managing employee data. It is currently implemented as a single-file C++ application, but future versions will adopt a modular structure for better scalability and maintainability.

---

## ✨ Planned Features

Here are some features planned for future updates:

- **User Authentication:**  
  - Employee and HR login system  
  - Secure password storage (hashed, not plain text)

- **Improved File Handling:**  
  - Better error recovery  
  - Safer and more reliable data storage

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**  
  - A planned GUI version for easier and more intuitive use

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  - Second version will split components into separate files (e.g., panels and systems) for clarity and ease of maintenance

---

## 📁 Current Status

- This project is at an **early/experimental stage**.
- All code currently resides in a single `.cpp` file for simplicity during prototyping.
- Basic employee management features may be present (add, edit, delete, list employees), but expect rapid changes and improvements.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

1. Build core employee management features (**in progress**)
2. Add user authentication and secure password storage
3. Refactor file handling and improve error management
4. Develop a GUI version
5. Migrate to a modular, multi-file architecture (in a new repo: `Employee-management-system-v2`)
